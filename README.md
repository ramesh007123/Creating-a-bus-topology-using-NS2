# Creating-a-bus-topology-using-NS2
# Bus Topology Simulation in NS2

## AIM

To create and monitor a Bus Topology and effective data transmission using NS2 Software.

## APPARATUS REQUIRED

*   PC System with Linux OS
*   NS2 software

## ALGORITHM
 
* STEP 1: Start the program. 
* STEP 2: Declare the global variables ns for creating a new simulator. 
* STEP 3: Open the network animator file in the write mode. 
* STEP 4: Open the trace file in the write mode. 
* STEP 5: Transfer the packets in network. 
* STEP 6: Create the capable no of nodes. 
* STEP 7: Create the duplex-link between the nodes including the delay time, bandwidth 
and dropping queue mechanism. 
* STEP 8: Set a tcp connection for source node. 
* STEP 9: Set the destination node using tcp sink. 
* STEP 10: Set the window size and the packet size for the tcp. 
* STEP 11: Set up the ftp over the tcp connection. 
* STEP 12: Create the traffic generator CBR for the source and destination files. 
* STEP 13: Define the plot window and finish procedure. 
* STEP 14: In the definition of the finish procedure declare the global variables. 
* STEP 15: Close the trace file and namefile and execute the network animation 
file.
* STEP 16: At the particular time call the finish procedure. 
* STEP 17: Stop the program.
